## Building Intuition for Classification

An interactive app for learning and building intuition for classification tasks in machine learning.

__Goal__:  You work for the CDC and you are tasked with creating a model that suggests whether or not one should be screened for heart disease. 

__Dataset__: The data we will use to construct the model comes from the 2015 [Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm) Public health surveys, conducted 
by the CDC. The cleaned dataset and details on all features can be found 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset).
 _Thanks_ to Alex Teboul for cleaning the data.

__Desired Learning Outcome__: Gain intuition for machine learning concepts by considering the real world problem of 
creating a machine learning model for suggesting whether or not one should be screened for heart disease based 
on lifestyle and health metrics.
